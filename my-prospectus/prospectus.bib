	abstract={For scatterplots with gaussian distributions of dots, the perception of Pearson correlation r can be described by two simple laws: a linear one for discrimination, and a logarithmic one for perceived magnitude (Rensink {\&} Baldridge, 2010). The underlying perceptual mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. To cast light on these, four different distributions of datapoints were examined. The first had 100 points with equal variance in both dimensions. Consistent with earlier results, just noticeable difference (JND) was a linear function of the distance away from r = 1, and the magnitude of perceived correlation a logarithmic function of this quantity. In addition, these laws were linked, with the intercept of the JND line being the inverse of the bias in perceived magnitude. Three other conditions were also examined: a dot cloud with 25 points, a horizontal compression of the cloud, and a cloud with a uniform distribution of dots. Performance was found to be similar in all conditions. The generality and form of these laws suggest that what underlies correlation perception is not a geometric structure such as the shape of the dot cloud, but the shape of the probability distribution of the dots, likely inferred via a form of ensemble coding. It is suggested that this reflects the ability of observers to perceive the information entropy in an image, with this quantity used as a proxy for Pearson correlation.},

	abstract = {Despite years of research yielding systems and guidelines to aid
	visualization design, practitioners still face the challenge of
	identifying the best visualization for a given dataset and task.
	One promising approach to circumvent this problem is to leverage
	perceptual laws to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of a
	visualization design. Following previously established
	methodologies, we conduct a large scale (n=1687) crowdsourced
	experiment to investigate whether the perception of correlation
	in nine commonly used visualizations can be modeled using Weber's
	law. The results of this experiment contribute to our
	understanding of information visualization by establishing that:
	(1) for all tested visualizations, the precision of correlation
	judgment could be modeled by Weber's law, (2) correlation
	judgment precision showed striking variation between negatively
	and positively correlated data, and (3) Weber models provide a
	concise means to quantify, compare, and rank the perceptual
	precision afforded by a visualization.},
